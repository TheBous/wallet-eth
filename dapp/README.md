This starter template is setup for using regular Javascript (.js, .jsx) and/or Typescript (.ts, .tsx), CSS/SCSS (.css, .scss)and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Its up to you how to want to build it.

Webpack has been configured for es6/javascript/typescript, scss, and react hot loader support.
